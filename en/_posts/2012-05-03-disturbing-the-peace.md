Ai Weiwei studio production *Lao Ma Ti Hua* is a documentary of an incident that took place during Tan Zuoren’s trial on August 12, 2009. Tan Zuoren was charged with "inciting subversion of state power". Chengdu police detained witnesses during the trial of the civil rights advocate, which is an obstruction of justice and an act of violence. Tan Zuoren was charged as a result of his research and questioning regarding the 5.12 Wenchuan student casualties and the corruption which resulted in poor building construction. Tan Zuoren was sentenced to five years in prison.
